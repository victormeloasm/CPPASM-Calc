## New in Version 2.1

### Basic Operations Improvements

Version 2.0 brings a significant update to basic operations:
- **Automatic Focus:** After each basic mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), the focus is automatically returned to the input field (`Edit1`), allowing the user to continue typing without needing to manually click on the field.

### Detailed Updates

#### Addition (`Button22Click`)
- **Description:** Performs addition between two numbers.
- **Behavior:** Updates the input field with the result and returns the focus to the input field.

#### Subtraction (`Button25Click`)
- **Description:** Performs subtraction between two numbers.
- **Behavior:** Updates the input field with the result and returns the focus to the input field.

#### Multiplication (`Button24Click`)
- **Description:** Performs multiplication between two numbers.
- **Behavior:** Updates the input field with the result and returns the focus to the input field.

#### Division (`Button23Click`)
- **Description:** Performs division between two numbers and handles division by zero.
- **Behavior:** Updates the input field with the result and returns the focus to the input field.
